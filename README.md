!! BETA-log is a modified version of BETAFLIGHT for GYRO/ACC logging.
Gyro filtering, and highly configurable blackbox logging plus board alignment configuration are a perfect features for 3D logging/tracking applications.
This version of Betaflight allows to select only Gyro and ACC logging and converts a lot of used/damaged 20x20 FCs into logging devices for these tools:

(https://github.com/Cleric-K/BlackboxToGPMF)

Targets are missing motor outputs and Timers and can be found in BETA-log-FIRMWARE:
Use (https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases/tag/10.7.0) to flash and set up your FC.

We provide also CLI commands for some target to set pre defined Board-Orientation and disable all Blackbox items but GYRO and ACC

Betaflight is flight controller software (firmware) used to fly multi-rotor craft and fixed wing craft.

This fork differs from Baseflight and Cleanflight in that it focuses on flight performance, leading-edge feature additions, and wide target support.

## Features

Betaflight has the following features:

* Multi-color RGB LED strip support (each LED can be a different color using variable length WS2811 Addressable RGB strips - use for Orientation Indicators, Low Battery Warning, Flight Mode Status, Initialization Troubleshooting, etc)
* DShot (150, 300, 600 and 1200), Multishot, and Oneshot (125 and 42) motor protocol support
* Blackbox flight recorder logging (to onboard flash or external microSD card where equipped)
* Support for targets that use the STM32 F7, F4 and F3 processors
* PWM, PPM, and Serial (SBus, SumH, SumD, Spektrum 1024/2048, XBus, etc) RX connection with failsafe detection
* Multiple telemetry protocols (CSRF, FrSky, HoTT smart-port, MSP, etc)
* RSSI via ADC - Uses ADC to read PWM RSSI signals, tested with FrSky D4R-II, X8R, X4R-SB, & XSR
* OSD support & configuration without needing third-party OSD software/firmware/comm devices
* OLED Displays - Display information on: Battery voltage/current/mAh, profile, rate profile, mode, version, sensors, etc
* In-flight manual PID tuning and rate adjustment
* Rate profiles and in-flight selection of them
* Configurable serial ports for Serial RX, Telemetry, ESC telemetry, MSP, GPS, OSD, Sonar, etc - Use most devices on any port, softserial included
* VTX support for Unify Pro and IRC Tramp
* and MUCH, MUCH more.

## Installation & Documentation
